:::danger[Breaking Changes]

These callouts cover changes to behavior available in `v1.102.0`, the previous stable release

**This release adds an index on `LiteLLM_SpendLogs`, which blocks spend log writes while it builds at startup.** On a large table that can take a long time. To avoid this, build the index yourself before upgrading with `CONCURRENTLY`, which does not block writes. The migration then finds it and skips the build. See [PR #37983](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/37983)

```sql
SET statement_timeout = 0;
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS "LiteLLM_SpendLogs_api_key_startTime_idx" ON "LiteLLM_SpendLogs"("api_key", "startTime");
```

Run it outside a transaction, from a session that stays connected until it finishes. A failed concurrent build leaves an invalid index behind, and the migration would skip that too, so check it before upgrading. This must return `true`, otherwise run `DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY "LiteLLM_SpendLogs_api_key_startTime_idx";` and build it again:

```sql
SELECT indisvalid FROM pg_index WHERE indexrelid = '"LiteLLM_SpendLogs_api_key_startTime_idx"'::regclass;
```

If your spend logs table is partitioned, Postgres cannot build its index concurrently. Build a matching index concurrently on each partition first, then run the same `CREATE INDEX` without `CONCURRENTLY` on the parent, which only attaches them

**The config file now owns every setting it declares, and the database no longer overrides it.** One rule replaces the per-key mix of DB-wins, config-wins and merged precedence: if `config.yaml` declares a key, the file owns it and a runtime write to that key is refused with a 400 naming the file to edit, instead of being stored and silently ignored. This covers `POST /config/field/update`, `POST /config/field/delete`, `POST /config/update`, and the `allowed_ips` routes. Keys the file leaves out still come from the database and stay editable. `GET /config/field/info` and `GET /config/list` now resolve through the same store and report `source` and `editable`, and a config-owned field reports the value the file declares, so an `os.environ/...` reference is returned as written rather than resolved. In the Admin UI a config-owned field renders read-only. Startup warns once per key whose stored database value is being ignored, and the refusal carries the same sentence plus `stored_database_value_ignored: true`. Move any setting you edit at runtime out of the config file, or edit the file and restart. See [PR #41779](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/41779), [PR #41862](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/41862), [PR #41868](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/41868), [PR #41931](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/41931), [PR #41985](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/41985), [PR #42009](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/42009)

**Budgets are re-checked on every router fallback target.** A request that starts on a free model and falls back to a paid one is now gated at the fallback, and targets the caller cannot pay for are skipped rather than served. The primary attempt is unchanged. Workflows that relied on a free primary carrying an over-budget key onto a paid fallback will now receive the next affordable target or a budget error. See [PR #41379](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/41379)

**An organization or project `max_budget` of 0 now means zero allowance, not unlimited.** This matches the existing key, team and user semantics. Set `max_budget` to `null` for unlimited. See [PR #41271](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/41271), [PR #41997](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/41997)

**A key's own per-model rpm/tpm override now beats the team's per-model limit.** Documented precedence (key metadata over team metadata) is now what the code does, on chat, batches and `/cost/predict-cache`. A key that overrides only RPM still has the team TPM pool enforced, and vice versa. Review teams that relied on the per-model team cap clamping keys that declare their own. See [PR #41302](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/41302)

**MCP servers with `delegate_auth_to_upstream: true` now require a LiteLLM credential.** Previously a request carrying only the upstream token in `Authorization` was let through with no LiteLLM identity, so anyone who could reach the gateway could use the server and its tool calls were missing from spend logs. Now a request without a LiteLLM credential has its upstream token validated as a LiteLLM key or JWT, which fails with a 401 such as `No matching public key found` (token signed by another issuer) or `Audience doesn't match` (token issued for the MCP server, not LiteLLM). To fix it, send the LiteLLM key or JWT in `x-litellm-api-key` and keep the upstream token in `Authorization`, which is forwarded to the MCP server, or migrate the server to `oauth_delegate`. A server that should stay reachable without LiteLLM auth can use `true_passthrough`, which deliberately keeps anonymous access. See [PR #40923](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/40923)

**A `CustomLogger` moderation callback now rejects the request.** `llm_api_check` moderation is dispatched through `during_call_hook`, so a flagged request returns 400 where it previously returned 200. See [PR #41685](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/41685)

**Bedrock Realtime requires `aws-sdk-bedrock-runtime` 0.10 or 0.11.** The pin moved to `aws-sdk-bedrock-runtime[awscrt]>=0.10.0,<0.12.0`; 0.7.x is no longer supported and the init error now distinguishes an absent SDK from an unsupported version. Nova Sonic sessions fail until operators install a supported SDK with the `awscrt` extra. See [PR #41542](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/41542)

**`/v1/rag/ingest` resolves the registered store and refuses providers without ingestion.** A request that names a registered store by id now uses that store's provider and `litellm_params` instead of defaulting to OpenAI Files, only per-upload options survive from the caller, and a provider with no ingestion implementation returns 400 naming the supported ones instead of a 200 with `status: failed` or a 500. See [PR #41940](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/41940)

**Capability and Fuse v2 routers are limited to one each without a license.** Registering a second router of either classifier returns 403 naming the `auto_router` entitlement. Existing routers are unaffected. See [PR #41326](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/41326)

**Pricing copied into `model_info` by pre-v1.102 Admin UI edits is ignored.** A stored `model_info` blob carrying a `key` field next to prices is treated as a copied `/model/info` response, so the row follows the cost map again and heals on its next save. Custom pricing declared in `litellm_params`, or typed without `key`, is untouched. `/model/info` now reports `model_info.pricing_overrides`. See [PR #41843](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/41843)

**The `litellm-proxy` entrypoint is deprecated in favour of `lite`.** It still runs, printing one deprecation line on stderr. `lite autoroute up` and `down` are renamed to `start` and `stop`, with the old names kept as deprecated aliases. See [PR #41673](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/41673), [PR #41672](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/41672)

**Repeated failed Admin UI sign-in attempts are throttled**, and `lite login` session tokens are re-checked against the live user and team rows, so a removed member gets 403, a deleted user 401, and a demoted admin loses admin routes on the next request after the cache window. See [PR #40982](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/40982), [PR #40657](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/40657)

:::

## Key Highlights

- **Config file ownership**: one precedence rule across every settings surface, a `source` and `editable` flag on both read endpoints, read-only fields in the Admin UI, and a startup warning naming each stored value the file is ignoring
- **Fuse and Capability routing**: a capability classifier, Fuse V2 after capability forecasting, per-model Fast mode, maintained Fuse model and harness presets, TypeSafe Jev as a complexity classifier, and heuristic v2 score estimates in routing details
- **Gateway hardening**: MCP client allowlisting, live session visibility with admin force-close, delegated OAuth admission, RFC 8693 token exchange for IdP JWTs, and per-issuer JWT key scoping
- **Spend and budget correctness**: per-member organization spend, project budgets enforced additively, team-level `model_max_budget` with key overrides, temporary budget increases, lifetime `total_spend` on keys, and budgets re-checked on fallback targets
- **408 new model catalog entries**: additions across OpenRouter, AIHubMix, Azure, Together AI, Vertex AI, Deepgram and others, with 147 pricing corrections

## Included after the v1.103.0-rc.1 cut

The stable tag includes these release-line additions:

- **Prompt caching** applies configured `cache_control_injection_points` beside client cache marks, keeps `prompt_caching` pinning when a replayed `redacted_thinking` block is present, and stands the automatic cache points down on `/v1/messages` when `extra_body` hides a client's own mark - [PR #41956](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/41956), [PR #42069](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/42069), [PR #43341](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/43341)
- **MCP** `/v1/mcp/tools` returns camelCase `inputSchema` and `outputSchema` again after the MCP SDK 2 upgrade - [PR #42352](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/42352)
- **Rust bridge** keeps `/v1/messages`, the token counter and the tokenizer on Python when `LITELLM_RUST=1` is set, so compaction edits no longer fail with 400 - [PR #42517](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/42517)
- **Bedrock** streams `/v1/messages` Invoke bytes through instead of holding them in a 1024-byte chunker - [PR #42607](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/42607)
- **Streaming** keeps LiteLLM's `Usage` on text-completion usage chunks, so `/v1/completions` streams with `include_usage` end with token counts instead of an error - [PR #43047](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/43047)
- **JWT and OpenTelemetry**: `x-litellm-team-id` accepts a team alias, its 403 says it matched no team id or alias, and with `fallback_to_db_teams` on it can select any DB team the caller belongs to. v2 LLM spans carry the caller's session id as `gen_ai.conversation.id` - [PR #42445](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/42445), [PR #42495](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/42495), [PR #43206](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/43206), [PR #42486](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/42486)
- **Proxy reliability** stops DB config reloads from leaking background tasks, passes team member spend rows as `jsonb` so a $0 flush cannot poison a pooled connection, and unregisters logging callbacks removed from the stored config - [PR #42784](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/42784), [PR #43029](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/43029), [PR #43429](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/43429)
- **Usage pages** load spend for every key again. The top-N key cap and the daily global spend rollup reads from rc.1 were reverted before stable, while the `LiteLLM_DailyGlobalSpend` table and migration stay in place, so [PR #41293](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/41293) and [PR #41324](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/41324) are no longer listed below - [PR #43326](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/43326)
