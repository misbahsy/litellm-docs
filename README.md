# litellm-docs

Source for [docs.litellm.ai](https://docs.litellm.ai); the documentation site for [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm).

Built with [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to see the site with live reload.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Static output goes to `build/`.

The build renders up to four pages and optimizes up to two images at a time to fit the 8 GB Vercel build machine. Set `DOCUSAURUS_SSR_CONCURRENCY` to override page-rendering concurrency when running `npm run build` on a different machine.

## Deploy

Deploys are handled automatically by Vercel on push to `main`.

## Contributing
